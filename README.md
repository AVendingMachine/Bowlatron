# Bowlatron

An application for practicing Quizbowl Literature topics centered around dynamic learning

- You input the clues
- Bowlatron makes the questions
- Centered around authors and works, may be expanded to other topics
- Has groundwork laid for there to be audio associated with each clue

## TODO

1. Finish database writer for all 4 tables (authors,works,questions A/W)
2. Create text-based system that displays hard-medium-easy clues in order with response system
3. Keep track of points using some kind of rating system, save locally
4. Make everything look nicer
5. Tidy up code mess (if possible)
6. Audio recording?? (design rest of project with this in mind but don't implement till later)
7. Possibly make the design more flexible so I can add more subjects (optional)
